# Portfolio website - sonsun.dev

Source code for my personal portfolio website [sonsun.dev](https://sonsun.dev). Built using React and Material UI, with serverless backend functions supported by Netlify.

Animated background created with [tsParticles](https://particles.js.org/), design inspired by [Retrospring](https://retrospring.net/).
